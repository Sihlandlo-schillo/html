    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul> <li><h2>Football</h2></li>
<p>I am keen in playing my part in football cause I love it with all I've got. <br>I want to build a football club and help all those in the rurals who are still below the age of 16. Show them that it's possible</p>
    <li><h2>Singing</h2></li> 
<p>Well, this one is for the books, I've never been in a choir (school). <br>My high school friends heard me singing and they were like "Nigga!, You should consider being in a Choir." <br> And yeah, One day I'mma persue this talent </p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <ul><li><h2>Graduate</h2></li>
<p> Oh yeah, working smart with a fair bit of effort, I will get there. <br> Submitting/writing all the tasks and quizes assigned to us as a class is the ultimate goal </p>
    <li><h2>Internship</h2></li>
<p> Oh well, this one is the short-term goal, <i>same as the one above</i>. <br> Having the workplace experience is the best that would happen to me.</p></ul>
